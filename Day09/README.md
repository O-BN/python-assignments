# NCBI Sequence Analysis Tool

This Python script automates the process of downloading sequence files from NCBI, validating them, and performing analyses like finding the longest repeated subsequence and calculating GC content. The results are saved to a summary report for easy reference.

## Features
- **Download from NCBI**: Fetches sequence files from the NCBI database (e.g., `nucleotide`) based on a search term, organism, and number of records.
- **File Validation**: Ensures files are in valid FASTA or GenBank format before analysis.
- **Longest Repeated Subsequence**: Identifies and reports the longest repeated subsequence in each sequence.
- **GC Content Analysis**: Calculates the GC percentage for the sequence with the longest repeated subsequence.
- **Error Handling**: Skips problematic files and logs a warning.
